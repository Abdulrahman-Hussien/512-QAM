# 512-QAM SYSTEM
### In this project, it's required to implement a full modulation system with the 512-QAM modulation technique using Matlab code.
The system consists of 3 parts (Mapper, channel, demapper).  
The code should:  
* Pass a random stream of bits through the whole modulation scheme with Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) in dB that takes the values {30, 10, 5, 0, -3 dB}.  
* Sketch the constellation diagram of the signals at the input and output of the AWGN channel.  
* Plot the relation between the BER vs. Eb/No in dB where Eb is the bit energy and No is the noise spectral density.  
* Plot the theoretical relation between BER and Eb/No in dB for your modulation scheme vs. the simulated one.

* The project was done in Jan. 2022 *
